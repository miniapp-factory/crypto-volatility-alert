The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` constants.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create this file to describe the logo image that should be generated.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized, modern logo featuring a dynamic cryptocurrency price chart with a bold upward trend line and a sharp downward spike, set against a gradient background transitioning from deep navy blue at the top to teal at the bottom. The chart is centered and slightly tilted, with a subtle glowing effect around the lines to convey real-time monitoring. A small lightning bolt overlays the chart to symbolize volatility, and the overall composition is clean, flat, and professional, suitable for a crypto trading alert app.
